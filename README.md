## 项目教程 / Guide

当Hotaru.TS还是Hotaru.JS时我写了一点教程，现在虽已不适用（过去采用React + Express、通信全靠Socket.io的开发形式），但是可以作为参考。

When Hotaru.TS was still Hotaru.JS, I wrote few tutorial posts. Although it is no longer applicable (the development mode was React + Express, and the communication was all based on Socket.io), it can still be used as a reference.

项目从Express迁移到NestJS后，我写了一篇迁移指南。

After the project was migrated from Express to NestJS, I wrote a migration guide.
